Current Final Year Project progress

Topic: Segmentation and recognition of plant disease leaf in a complex environment using moment invariants and a hybrid learning approach

Dataset used (Cassava Leaf Disease): https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/data 

moment_functions.py contains the code for calculating Tchebichef Moment Invariance
params_train.py & params_test.py passes parameters for calculation
